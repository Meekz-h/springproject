#  a Spring application with a Java back end and an Angular front end
## This project showcases my ability to write code to do the following: multithreaded language translation, currency exchange and a message at different time zones. 
<p>This is a demo hotel scheduling applicaiton for events and gatherings. I coded a welcome message to appear in English and French via threads that pull the welcome message from a resource bundle. I also created methods to convert timezones (EST,UTC,MT) and currencies as well.</p>
